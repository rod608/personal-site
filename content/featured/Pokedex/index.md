A Next.js web app that allows users to fetch information on any of the original 151 Pokémon thanks to the RESTful PokéAPI.

Filter through the list of Pokémon by name and click on a card to view more information on that specific Pokémon. Each card is routed to a unique server-side rendered page with information on the specific Pokémon. An instant loading state from the server is delivered while the content of a route segment loads.
