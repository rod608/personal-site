- Saved roughly 4-6 hours per use in production by developing an XML-based one-click automated solution that unblocks a queue of stalled actuarial sensitivity runs.
- Developed Python scripts that extract matching log entries via regex, transform the data using pandas, and load the data to excel, making hundreds of log files digestible. Unit Tested using pytest.
- Refactored an existing Python-based AWS Secure File Transfer Protocol script to leverage the AsyncSSH and AsyncIO packages, allowing for concurrent SSH operations.
